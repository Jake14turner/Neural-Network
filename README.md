# Neural-Network
This is the first Neural Network I a have created. Basic neural network with two layers. Uses the sigmoid function to get the output between 0 and 1.

There are four files titled "2LayerNetwork_1 - 4". Each file is building off the previous and the final file "2LayerNetwork_4" is the complete neural network. 

Some of my main takeaways from this project were as follows:
1. Neural Networks are incredibly fascinating as they involve calculus, statistics, and other forms of math which I enjoy.
2. There are alot of different areas where I could impliment a network and I am excited to explore them.
3. Taking time to understand exaclty how all the math works and not using libraries as shortcuts really helped me to grasp topics like weights, biases, nodes, backpropogation, activation functions, and learning rates.
4. I have never used a library like matplotlib.pyplot to visualize my data in python and I found it extremely helpful for visualization. I'm looking forward to using it in future projects.
